# The default wasn't previously applied correctly
# The problem here was a series of choice groups and selects etc could cause the configuration system to become confused.
# Because update_defaults would only consider two of the configuration options (the one potentially affected by a change
# in dependencies and the current selected one) it would not update to the 'best' option (i.e. the default in this case).
# ASSERT: DEFAULT_OPTION=y
